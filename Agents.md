## Locales

- `EnhanceQoL` uses one central AceLocale namespace: `EnhanceQoL`.
- Core locale files live only in `EnhanceQoL/Locales/<locale>.lua`.
- Do not add or recreate module locale files under `EnhanceQoL/Modules/*/Locales`.
- `EnhanceQoLSharedMedia` is a separate addon and keeps its own locale files in `EnhanceQoLSharedMedia/Locales/<locale>.lua`.
- CurseForge is not the source of truth for translations anymore. Locale changes are maintained locally in git.

### Supported Locales

- `enUS`
- `deDE`
- `esES`
- `esMX`
- `frFR`
- `itIT`
- `koKR`
- `ptBR`
- `ruRU`
- `zhCN`
- `zhTW`

### Required Workflow

- Every user-facing text change must update all supported locale files in the same change.
- Do not leave new, renamed, or rewritten strings in English only.
- Do not postpone locale propagation to a later follow-up commit or PR.
- A locale change is incomplete until the key set matches across every supported locale file.
- When adding a key, add it to every locale file.
- When renaming a key, rename it in every locale file.
- When removing a key, remove it from every locale file.
- Keep the locale files alphabetically sorted by key so diffs stay reviewable.
- Keep the same key names across all locales. Only the translated values should differ.

### Implementation Rules

- In core addon Lua files, use the unified locale table from `LibStub("AceLocale-3.0"):GetLocale("EnhanceQoL")` or `GetLocale(addonName)` when `addonName` is `EnhanceQoL`.
- Do not use old module-specific locale namespaces such as `EnhanceQoL_Aura`, `EnhanceQoL_MythicPlus`, `EnhanceQoL_Mover`, `EnhanceQoL_Vendor`, or similar.
- Do not introduce redundant locale aliases like `LMain`, `LCore`, `LVendor`, or `LMP` when they all point to the same `EnhanceQoL` locale table.
- Prefer Blizzard globals such as `_G.NONE` or `_G.STATUS_TEXT_BOTH` when the game already provides the text, instead of creating duplicate locale keys for them.

### Validation

- Before finishing locale work, verify that every `EnhanceQoL/Locales/*.lua` file has the same keys.
- Before finishing locale work, verify that key order is still alphabetically sorted.
- Before finishing locale work, verify that no module locale folders were reintroduced under `EnhanceQoL/Modules`.

## Release and Beta Packaging

- Releases use `BigWigsMods/packager@v2` through `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- BigWigs supports beta release types for tags such as `10.10.0-beta1`, but it does not support `@beta@` as a native content gate.
- Do not use raw BigWigs-style `@beta@` markers for project gating.
- EnhanceQoL uses its own pre-packager gate script: `scripts/prepare_packager_gates.sh`.
- Use `eqol-beta` markers for content that should exist only in beta packages:
  - TOC/TXT/Markdown: `#@eqol-beta@` through matching `#@end-eqol-beta@`.
  - Markdown also supports `<!--@eqol-beta@-->` through `<!--@end-eqol-beta@-->`; prefer this HTML-comment form in `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Lua: `--@eqol-beta@` through `--@end-eqol-beta@`.
  - XML: `<!--@eqol-beta@-->` through `<!--@end-eqol-beta@-->`.
- Use `non-eqol-beta` markers only for content that should exist in non-beta packages.
- For TOC, Markdown, and TXT files, non-matching gated blocks are removed by the script.
- For Lua and XML files, non-matching gated blocks are commented out by the script to keep line numbers more stable for bug reports.
- If the user asks to make or update a beta changelog, keep the beta section in `CHANGELOG.md` wrapped in `<!--@eqol-beta@-->` and `<!--@end-eqol-beta@-->`.
- If the user asks to prepare a release changelog while a beta changelog should remain available, keep the beta-gated section separate and place the release section below it, outside the beta gate.
- Do not merge beta-only changelog entries into a release section unless the user explicitly says those beta items are shipping in that release.
- After changing packaging gates, verify `scripts/prepare_packager_gates.sh` with at least `bash -n`, and make sure the release workflow still runs Luacheck after the gate step.

## EditMode MultiDropdowns

- `SettingType.MultiDropdown` callbacks must not rebuild or refresh the open EditMode settings dialog while the dropdown menu is open.
- In `setSelected` handlers, update the underlying config and any affected preview/runtime frames only. Avoid calls that recreate the dialog or pooled settings rows, such as direct `UpdateSettings()` calls or helper paths that rebuild the standalone settings UI.
- Let the EditMode settings library handle its own deferred refresh after selection changes. Rebuilding the dialog from inside a dropdown selection can corrupt the dropdown button text, causing the clicked checkbox label to appear as the dropdown's selected value.
- For concrete patterns, follow the `SettingType.MultiDropdown` entries in `EnhanceQoL/Modules/Aura/UF_GroupFrames.lua`: use `values`, `isSelected`, and `setSelected`, and keep UI rebuilds outside the selection callback.
